# Nixyosys (Name is WIP)
**Tools to be able to describe how to build HDL projects and load them to FPGAs using Yosys and Nix.**

This project aims to allow the usage of nix as a project builder for HDL projects, easing the use of dependencies and the routing/packing/loading for diferent FPGAs.

For now only VHDL projects are supported, using ghdl as the compiler, and only the gowin board _Tang Primer 20K_ has been added as a pre-defined board.
